A simple Python-based Caesar Cipher tool that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages via a command-line interface. This classic cipher shifts alphabetic characters by a specified number of positions while preserving non-letter characters like punctuation and spaces.

## 💡 Features

- Encrypt or decrypt messages
- Supports uppercase and lowercase letters
- Non-alphabet characters are left unchanged
- Simple terminal interaction (no external libraries required)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📦 Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system

- 🧠 How It Works
The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3:

A becomes D

B becomes E

...

X becomes A

Non-letter characters (spaces, punctuation, numbers) are not changed.
